It has inbuilt mechanisms to maintain models and connect to databases(only MySQL for now).\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\nThis repo contains a salt cmd tool.\r\n```shell\r\nsalt create [appname]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### App structure\r\nIt creates a folder of the same name with a sample app contained in it.\r\nThe general folder stucture will be like : (Sample App name : sampleapp)\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- sampleapp/\r\n          |------- app.json\r\n          |------- sampleapp.go\r\n     \t  |------- sampleapp/\r\n                        |------- app.go\r\n                        |------- models.go\r\n                        |------- urls.go\r\n                        |------- views.go\r\n          |------- static/\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### app.json\r\nThe file app.json is the app configuration for the web application.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"Debug\" : true,\r\n    \"ListenVars\" : {\r\n        \"Port\" : \"8080\",\r\n        \"Address\": \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Static\" : {\r\n        \"StaticURI\" : \"/static/\",\r\n        \"StaticDirs\" : [\"static/\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"Database\" : {\r\n        \"Username\" : ${Username},\r\n        \"Password\" : ${Password},\r\n        \"Database\" : ${Database}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe json fields are self explainatory.\r\nNow change the variables accordingly for you set-up. Be sure to change the Database connection settings.\r\n\r\n#### sampleapp.go or [appname].go\r\nThis is the entry point of the binary. ie., This is the \"main\" package or conatins the main function.\r\nRoot app and other apps are added and managed through this entry point.\r\n\r\n#### sampleapp/\r\nThis is the directory that contains the root app's contents. The name of the root app can be changed by changing the\r\npackage name in the go files in the directory and the bettr the directory itself. The app can be reconfigured after\r\nrenaming from the [appname].go\r\n\r\n#### app.go\r\nThis is the app setting file or the app configuration file. Name of the app, Models, URL routing patterns and Base\r\nURL can be specified in this file.\r\n\r\n#### models.go\r\nThis contains the models. These models get automatically migrated when the app is being run. Yet there is an issue\r\nthat if the model description change for a particular table, migration of database to the new table configuration\r\nis not implemented.\r\nBefore running the app please be sure to form the models or clear all the models (if not using). This may affect\r\nyour mysql database.\r\n\r\n#### urls.go\r\nSimple. This contains the urls routing patterns. salt has been written so that URL regexp matching is done during runtime.\r\nSo salt is not only limited to1 static URL routing (as in net/http)\r\n\r\n#### views.go\r\nThis contains the functions that generates the views for the specified URL Patterns. Add a new view and a url routing\r\nbefore running the new app or remove the import statement in this file.\r\n\r\n### Run the app\r\nTo run it either\r\n```shell\r\nsalt run [appname]\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```shell\r\ngo run [appname].go\r\n```\r\ninside that folder.\r\n\r\nYou can see the home page like this:\r\n![Salt Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aki237/salt/master/res/home.png)\r\n\r\nDocumentation is under process. For now refer to the godoc page. For further issues, well, use the github issue utility to file any.\r\n",
